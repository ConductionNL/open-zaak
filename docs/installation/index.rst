Installation
============

There are several ways to install Open Zaak. A scalable solution is to use
:ref:`Kubernetes<deployment_kubernetes>`. You can also run the
:ref:`Docker containers<deployment_containers>` on a single machine.

Before you begin
----------------

* Check the :ref:`minimum system requirements<installation_hardware>` for the target
  machine(s).
* Make sure the target machine(s) have access to the Internet.
* The target machine(s) should be reachable via at least a local DNS entry:

  * Open Zaak: ``open-zaak.<organization.local>``
  * `Open Notificaties`_: ``open-notificaties.<organization.local>``

  The machine(s) do not need to be publically accessible and do not need a public DNS
  entry. In some cases, you might want this but it's not recommended. The same machine
  can be used for both Open Zaak and `Open Notificaties`_.

* If you want to use `NLX`_, make sure you have a publicaly available domain name, for
  example ``nlx.<organization.com>``, where your NLX-inway is accessible to the outside
  world.

Post-install checklist
----------------------

After Open Zaak has been installed successfully, go through the following checklist
to see if the software works as expected:

**Check configuration**

Check the configuration page for Open Zaak, accessible at the url ``https://open-zaak.gemeente.nl/view-config/``.
This page will indicate whether certain settings are properly configured:

**Run check management commands**

If Sentry was set up for Open Zaak, make sure to run the following command to
ensure that logging to Sentry will work as expected:

.. code-block:: shell

    python src/manage.py raven test

Furthermore, to verify that notifications can be received by the URL as defined
in the configuration, send a test notification using the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    python src/manage.py send_test_notification

.. note:: The notification is sent to the ``test`` channel - make sure it exists in the
   Notificaties API you're using!

**Run the Postman collection**

Finally, run a simple Postman collection on the new install of Open Zaak:

* Create an ``Applicatie`` with superuser permissions via the admin
* A simple Postman collection has been published `here`_, click on the ``Run in Postman`` button
  in the top right.
* Once the collection is loaded into Postman, click the icon in the top right to manage environments:

* Then click ``Add``, enter the correct environment variables, then click ``Update``:

* Click on the ``Runner`` button in the top left of the screen, then select the
  imported collection and the created environment and click ``Run``

* If Open Zaak is properly configured, the tests will pass
